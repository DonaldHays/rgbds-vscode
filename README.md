# RGBDS GBZ80

This extension provides support for the RGBDS flavor of the Game Boy's Z80 variant assembly language in Visual Studio Code.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting Grammar

A full grammar definition for syntax highlighting is included.

### Documented Instruction Snippets

Instruction snippets reveal and document every instruction the Game Boy CPU understands. The documentation even includes the number of cycles instructions take!

### Problem Matcher

An included problem matcher enables Visual Studio Code to highlight invalid lines of code when you compile.

### Documented Symbol Detection

Symbols you declare are detected and populated in Intellisense prompts. It even grabs your documentation comments!
- Any uninterrupted runs of lines that consist only of comments preceding a symbol declaration will be considered part of that symbol's documentation.
- A comment on the same line as a symbol declaration is also part of its documentation.

### Documentation Hovers

Hover over symbol references to see their documentation at a glance.

## Usage

The language support will automatically activate for any file with `.z80`, `.asm`, `.inc`, `.s`, or `.sm83` file extensions.

### Using the Problem Matchers

The `rgbasm` problem matcher is named "rgbdserror", and the `rgblink` problem matcher is named "rgbdslinkerror". The following is an example of a build task that calls `make` and uses the problem matchers.

```JSON
{
  "label": "build",
  "type": "shell",
  "command": "make",
  "group": {
    "kind": "build",
    "isDefault": true
  },
  "presentation": {
    "panel": "new"
  },
  "problemMatcher": ["$rgbdserror", "$rgbdslinkerror"]
}
```

### Include Path Searching

This extension supports Intellisense for symbols declared in included files. By default, it searches for included files relative to the directory of the open file. But you can configure additional directories to search via the `rgbdsz80.includePath` configuration variable. You may assign a string path or an array of string paths to that variable, and all associated directories will be searched in turn to resolve an included file. Configured paths may be either absolute or relative to the _workspace_ directory.

### Capitalization Formatting

You can customize capitalization rules for your code. See [Capitalization Formatting](https://github.com/DonaldHays/rgbds-vscode/blob/master/formatting.md) for details.
