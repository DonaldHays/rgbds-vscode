# Capitalization Formatting

RGBDS is case-insensitive for everything except labels, so `set` and `SET` are the same. Developers have different rules for how they prefer code be capitalized. This extension supports a robust, inheritance-based rule system for configuring capitalization. It allows configuring simple rules in as few as a single declaration, but also allows highly granular configurations.

## How it Works

You configure capitalization through the `rgbdsz80.formatting.capitalization` setting. It takes a dictionary containing _scopes_ as keys and _rules_ as values. The root scope is `language`. Every case-insensitive part of the language is classified under a tree that branches from the root scope. Rules can be `upper` or `lower`.

A rule applies to everything in a scope. Rules with a narrower scope override rules with a broader scope.

### Examples

#### All Lower
```
"rgbdsz80.formatting.capitalization": {
  "language": "lower",
}
```

```
include "MyHeader.inc"

section "My Section", rom0

routine::
  ld a, 0
```

#### All Upper
```
"rgbdsz80.formatting.capitalization": {
  "language": "upper",
}
```

```
INCLUDE "MyHeader.inc"

SECTION "My Section", ROM0

routine::
  LD A, 0
```

#### All Upper Except Section Declarations
```
"rgbdsz80.formatting.capitalization": {
  "language": "upper",
  "language.keyword.sectiondeclaration": "lower"
}
```

```
INCLUDE "MyHeader.inc"

section "My Section", rom0

routine::
  LD A, 0
```

#### All Upper Except `include`
```
"rgbdsz80.formatting.capitalization": {
  "language": "upper",
  "language.keyword.preprocessor.include": "lower"
}
```

```
include "MyHeader.inc"

SECTION "My Section", ROM0

routine::
  LD A, 0
```
